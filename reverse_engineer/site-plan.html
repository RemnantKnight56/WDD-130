      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>As a fan of video games, I know I’m not the only one who had my own ideas for how to make it better, or for some great feature that wasn’t already inside. The question is not if you can, but how can you do it? There are very few resources online, or if there are, they are difficult to find. Why can’t there be a collection of reverse-engineering documentation? It would be a great help to people wanting to go into a deep and rewarding hobby! All the while, they can see what I am doing in practice and discuss in forums and comment sections. For enthusiasts, they can simply watch, and those who want to get into the hobby can learn and join the fun! It can be a hub of activity for people who want to make games even better!</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People who are passionate about video games and low-level programming would have great ineterest in Retrohedron. This is intended to be a library of documentation on how to reverse engineer games and understand low-level code. It will not start out being a fantastic resources; it will eventually get there as I find documents, articles and images, which will not happen in one day. While there may be a small audience, I hope they would be a devoted one as I trawl through the internet to find old and new knowledge.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        [What is This Site?]

This site is at once a college project and a useful encyclopedia. This is designed to have references to my own projects for others to follow, as well as resources I’ve found handy for completing them. With a focus on old game consoles and games, 

[Who Am I?]

My name is Jeremy Cole. I live in Idaho, and I am currently in my Junior year at Brigham Young University-Idaho. I am completing my degree in Software Engineering, with a certificate in Embedded Systems.

Ever since I was little, I’ve enjoyed playing video games, particularly those on the trusty Gamecube. Since around 2018, I’ve been exploring this wonderful console and the games it has released for it. With it, I have explored the libraries of other consoles, such as the PS2, Xbox, Dreamcast, and GBA. I plan on exploring more in the future as well, but these alone have made me a devoted retro gamer.

[Who is This For?]

This site is for anyone who would also consider themselves a retro gamer, and those who are passionate about programming, game design, and other related subjects. Such a thing is not for the faint of heart; it can take quite a bit of work to understand how to develop your own game, or even make changes to another game’s code. That said, I aim for this site to be a reference for you, both from my own works, and the works of others.

[What is Here?]

Currently, this site has two pages: one for projects I have envisioned, and the other is a library of resources I have found in the form of links to web pages. These are references I have collected over the years in my research of homebrew tutorials and guides for these consoles, and I hope that if you use this site, it can be a wealth of knowledge for you as well.

[What Will This Become?]

Eventually, I plan on adding my own completed projects to the site, potentially with videos to go with them. Much as I’d like to use Youtube, I’m not a fan of their censorship practices. Another page can be added to make announcements for changes and added projects. I also plan on adding a discussion board so that all of you that manage to find this site can discuss amongst yourselves your own projects and the resources available here.

        Welcome to the Library! This is a collection of all the different links I’ve found in my journey to learn my about my favorite consoles, especially in how to make my own custom programs for them. Hopefully you can use these in a similar way!
